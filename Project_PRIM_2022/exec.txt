For graphical interface (SDL):

Linux : gcc -Wall -o prog_sdl main_sdl.c function.c stack.c list.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl2` -lm

Mac : gcc -Wall -o prog_sdl main_sdl.c function.c stack.c list.c -I include -L lib -l SDL2 -lm


Without graphical interface (SDL):

gcc -Wall -o prog main.c function.c stack.c list.c -lm



//There are 2 main.c one with the implementation of GUI (main_sdl.c) and another one is not (main.c)

//include and lib folders are needed for SDL library

//As the command for Linux and Mac is different I decided to create a Makefile for the program without graphical interface

//-lm is for math.h but I run just fine without it
